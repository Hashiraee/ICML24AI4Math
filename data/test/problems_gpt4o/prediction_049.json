    "question": "A hot dog store sells two products: its regular hot-dog, and a premium hot-dog with more toppings. The store makes x1 regular hot-dogs a day at a profit of $3 each and x2 premium hot-dogs a day at a profit of $5 each. (x1 and x2 are unknowns and they both must be greater than or equal to 0). Currently, the demand is limited to at most 100 regular hot-dogs per day and at most 250 premium hot-dogs per day. Also, the store can make a maximum of 300 hot-dogs of either type per day. How many of each hot-dog should be made to maximize profit?",
