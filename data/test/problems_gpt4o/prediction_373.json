    "question": "Robertville Furniture Company (RFC) makes two types of dressers: the Classic and the Modern. RFC sells the Classic for $310 and the Modern for $350. At these prices RFC believes it can sell up to 20 Classic and 25 Modern dressers per week. Each type of dresser is made of oak and covered with a pecan veneer. The wood requirements for each dresser are given in the table. Oak costs $1.50 per square foot, and pecan veneer costs $2 per square foot. The dressers must go through two manufacturing departments: cutting and veneering. The machine hours required for each dresser are also given below. The Oak Dresse size (square foot), Pecan Dresser size (square foot), cutting Time and Veneering Time for Classic and Modern are [90, 50, 1.20, 1.00] and [100, 60, 0.90, 1.20]. RFC has only 40 hours of production time available each week in each department, and it can obtain up to 2000 board feet of oak and 1500 square feet of pecan veneer each week. The cost of operating each manufacturing department is essentially fixed, so RFC would like to maximize its contribution to overhead (revenue minus variable costs).",
