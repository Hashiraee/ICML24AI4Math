    "question": "A toy company makes toys and knows that most of their customers are young boys and girls. To reach these groups, the company has decided to purchase commercial spots on cartoons and kids-movies. Each cartoon is seen by 2 millions young boys and 1 million young girls. Each kids-movie is seen by 4 million young boys and 6 million young girls. The company wants their commercials to be seen by at least 30 million young boys and 40 million young girls. If a commercial during a cartoon costs $5000 and a commercial during a kids-movie costs $12000, how many of each should be purchased to minimize cost?",
