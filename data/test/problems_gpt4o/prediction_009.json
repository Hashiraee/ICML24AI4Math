    "question": "A bakery only has 1000 units of blueberries to make pies and small tarts. Each pie needs 5 units of blueberries and each tart needs 3 units of blueberries. Since tarts are easier to eat quickly, the bakery must make at least three times as many tarts as pies. However, the bakery must make at least 30 pies. If each pie sold yields a profit of $8 and each tart sold yields a profit of $5, how many of each should the bakery make to maximize profit?",
