    "question": "Stockco is considering four investments. Investment 1 will yield a net present value (NPV) of $16,000; investment 2, an NPV of $22,000; investment 3, an NPV of $12,000; and in- vestment 4, an NPV of $8,000. Each investment requires a certain cash outflow at the pres- ent time: investment 1, $5,000; investment 2, $7,000; investment 3, $4,000; and investment 4, $3,000. Currently, $14,000 is available for investment. Formulate an LP whose solution will tell Stockco how to maximize the NPV obtained from investments 1-4.",
