    "question": "My cousin sells two different coffee blends: the Drummondville blend and the Victoriaville blend. Each blend contains both arabica and robusta coffee beans. A bag of the Drummondville blend contains 600 grams of arabica beans and 400 grams of robusta beans, whereas a bag of the Victoriaville blend contains 375 grams of arabica beans and 625 grams of robusta beans. The profit from each bag of Drummondville sold is $5 and the profit from each bag of Victoriaville blend sold is $7. If his total production must not exceed his available stock of 24000 grams of arabica beans and 17000 grams of robusta beans, how many bags of each type of blend should be blended to maximize profits? Formulate and solve.",
