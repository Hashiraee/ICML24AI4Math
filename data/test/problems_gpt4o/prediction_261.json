    "question": "A milk tea shop owner would like to sell two different milk teas: black milk tea and matcha milk tea. Each contains both milk and honey. A bottle of black milk tea contains 600 grams of milk and 10 grams of honey, whereas a bottle of matcha milk tea contains 525 grams of milk and 5 grams of honey. The profit from each bottle of black milk tea sold is $7.5 and the profit from each bottle of matcha milk tea sold is $5.
