    "question": "Out of a stock of three electronic components A,B and C given as 200, 120 and 150 respectively, it is required to produce two types of circuits. Circuit type 1 requires 20 resistors,10 transistors and 10 capacitors, while printed circuit type 2 requires 10 resistors, 20 transistors and 30 capacitors. If a type 1 circuit sells at Gh.5 cedis each and type 2 circuit at Gh.12 cedis each. Advice management about how many of each type should be made to get the maximum financial returns algebraically.",
    "results": {
        "The number of type 1 circuits to produce": "6.0",
        "The number of type 2 circuits to produce": "3.0",
        "The maximum financial returns": "66.0"
