    "question": "A farmer has 200 acres of land to grow oranges and grapefruits. He must grow at least 60 acres of oranges and at least 50 acres of grapefruits.

If the profit per acre of oranges is $200, and the profit per acre of grapefruits is $220, how many acres of each should be grown to maximize profit?",
