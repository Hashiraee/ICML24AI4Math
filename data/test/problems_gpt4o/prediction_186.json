    "question": "The Ace Manufacturing Company has orders for three similar products: A, B, and C with quantities of 1750, 500, and 1100 units respectively. Three machines are available for the manufacturing operations, and all three machines can produce all the products at the same production rate. However, the unit costs of the products vary depending on the machine used due to varying defect percentages. The machine capacities for the next week and the unit costs for producing each product on each machine are provided in the following tables. Use the transportation model to develop the minimum cost production schedule for the products and machines. Show the linear programming formulation. If the constant is \"1\" it must be entered in the box. If your answer is zero enter \"0\".\n\nTable (Machine capacities for the next week):\n| Machine | Capacity |\n|---------|----------|\n| 1       | 1550     |\n| 2       | 1450     |\n| 3       | 1150     |\n\nTable (Unit costs of products on each machine):\n| Product/Machine | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| A               | $0.80     | $1.40     | $0.80     |\n| B               | $1.30     | $1.30     | $0.80     |\n| C               | $0.70     | $1.50     | $1.20     |",
