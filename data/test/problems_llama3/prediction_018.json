    "question": "A cosmetics company makes high-end skincare products whose main customers are wealthy women, both young girls and middle-aged women. In order to promote their product line, they decided to invest in short commercial spots on two types of programs: social media and television. While each social media commercial is seen by 5 million young girls and 1 million middle-aged women, each television commercial is seen by 3 million young girls and 7 million middle-aged women. A 1-minute social media ad costs $30,000, and a 1-minute television ad costs $50,000. The company would like the commercials to be seen by at least 20 million young girls and 30 million middle-aged women. Use linear programming to determine how the cosmetics company can meet its advertising requirements at minimum cost.",
