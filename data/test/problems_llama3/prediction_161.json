    "question": "Dorian Auto has a $20,000 advertising budget. Dorian can purchase full-page ads in two magazines: Inside Jocks (IJ) and Family Square (FS). An exposure occurs when a person reads a Dorian Auto ad for the first time. The number of exposures generated by each ad in IJ and FS is detailed in the following Table. Each full-page ad in either magazine costs $1,000. Assume there is no overlap in the readership of the two magazines. Formulate an LP to maximize the number of exposures that Dorian can obtain with limited advertising funds.\n\nTable (The number of exposures generated by each ad):\n| Magazine | Ads 1-6 | Ads 7-10 | Ads 11-15 | Ads 16+ |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------- |\n| IJ       | 10,000   | 3,000    | 2,500     | 0       |\n| FS       | 8,000    | 6,000    | 2,000     | 0       |\n\nFor example, 8 ads in IJ would generate 6(10,000) + 2(3,000) = 66,000 exposures, and 13 ads in FS would generate 4(8,000) + 8(6,000) + 1(2,000) = 82,000 exposures.",
