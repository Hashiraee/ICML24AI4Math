    "question": "Two paints of different quality, cheap and expensive, have quality ratings of 50 and 90, respectively. The cheap paint costs $0.30 per liter while the expensive paint costs $1.50 per liter. In order to paint his fence, John wants to use a mix of paint with a quality of at least 80. This ensures that the paint on the fence will withstand a few storms. What blend of the two paints should he mix in order to minimize his cost? [Hint: Let x be the fraction of each liter that is cheap paint and y be the fraction that is expensive paint.]",
    "results": {
        "The fraction of each liter that is cheap paint": "0.25",
        "The fraction of each liter that is expensive paint": "0.75",
        "The minimized cost": "1.2"
