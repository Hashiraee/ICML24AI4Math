    "question": "The Curious electronics business wants to determine the level of production of its two hottest digital keyboards: A400 and P500. Making one A400 keyboard requires 5 hours of labour and yields a $35 profit. On the other hand, one P500 keyboard can be produced in 9 hours and offers a greater profit of $80. Given the demand forecast, the business decides to produce at least three times as many A400 keyboards as P500 ones. In addition, it can spend up to 45 hours a week to manufacture these keyboards. Can you help the business determine the number of each keyboard to be produced each week to obtain the maximum profit?",
