    "question": "The ABC Firefighting Equipment company operates two assembly plants and has two distribution centers. Plant A, located in Atlanta, can produce at most 800 alarm valves per week, while Plant B in Buffalo can produce at most 1000 alarm valves per week. Distribution Center I in Savannah must receive at least 900 alarm valves per week, and Center II in Pittsburgh must receive at least 600 alarm valves per week. The transportation costs per unit from the plants to the centers are provided in the following Table. Formulate the constraint inequalities that define the production limits for the plants and the requirements for the distribution centers, and create the total cost function that needs to be minimized. Solve the mixed constraint problem to find the minimum transportation cost.\n\nTable (Transportation costs per unit from plants to distribution centers):\n| From / To       | Center I (Savannah) | Center II (Pittsburgh) |\n|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Plant A (Atlanta) | $8                  | $12                    |\n| Plant B (Buffalo) | $16                 | $4                     |",
