    "question": "CE Chemicals produces two types of products, adhesives and plasticizers. To produce each type of product, we need to use both an automatic device and a human-operated device. On a given day, each processing device is available for at most 450 minutes. To extract a package of adhesives, it takes 6 minutes of processing on the automatic device and 5 minutes on human-operated device. To extract a package of plasticizers, the automatic device needs to be run for 8 minutes and the human-operated device for 4 minutes. The manufacturer can sell a package of adhesives for a revenue of $8.5 and plasticizers for a revenue of $11.5. Assuming that the company can sell all the products it produces, how many packages of each product should be produced daily in order to maximize the revenue?",
    "results": {
        "The number of packages of adhesives produced daily": "3",
        "The number of packages of plasticizers produced daily": "54",
        "The maximum daily revenue": "646.5"
