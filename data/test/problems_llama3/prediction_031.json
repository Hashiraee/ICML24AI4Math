    "question": "A car company makes two types of cars, a race car and a regular car. Two different teams produce each of these cars. The race car team can make at most 3 race cars per day while the regular car team can make at most 5 regular cars per day. Both cars need to go through a safety check, and in a day at most 6 cars of either type can be safety checked. If the profit per race car is $20000 and the profit per regular car is $10000, how many of each should the company make to maximize their profit?",
