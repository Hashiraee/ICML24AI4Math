    "question": "A clothing company makes flight jackets and denim jackets in their factory. A different team produces each kind of jacket and each team has a different maximum production rate: 10 flight jackets per day and 25 denim jackets per day respectively. Both teams require the use of a sewing machine and this machine can process at most 30 jackets per day of either type. While the flight jackets generate a profit of $70 per jacket, the denim jackets generate a profit of $100 per jacket. Assuming the company can sell all the jackets they make, how many of each type of jacket should they make to maximize profit?",

        "The number of denim jackets to produce": "25",
        "The maximum profit": "2850.0"
