    "question": "Out of a stock of three electronic components A, B, and C given as 200, 120, and 150 respectively, it is required to produce two types of circuits. Circuit type 1 requires 20 resistors, 10 transistors, and 10 capacitors, while circuit type 2 requires 10 resistors, 20 transistors, and 30 capacitors. Circuit type 1 sells at Gh.5 cedis each and type 2 circuit at Gh.12 cedis each. Advise management about how many of each type should be made to get the maximum financial returns algebraically.\n\nTable (Components required for each type of circuit):\n| Component | Circuit Type 1 | Circuit Type 2 | Stock Available |\n| --------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\n| A (Resistors) | 20             | 10             | 200             |\n| B (Transistors) | 10             | 20             | 120             |\n| C (Capacitors) | 10             | 30             | 150             |",
