    "question": "Suppose a company manufactures two products, A and B, using three inputs: labor, material R, and material S. The demands for the products are such that the company can sell as much of each product as it can produce and earn a profit of $3 per unit of A and $4 per unit of B. However, only 900 pounds of R, 675 pounds of S, and 1200 person-hours of labor are available to the company each day. Formulate the company's problem as a linear program to maximize profit.\n\nTable (The amount of each input required to make one unit of product):\n| Input       | Product A | Product B |\n| ----------- | --------- | --------- |\n| Material R  | 6 pounds  | 12 pounds |\n| Material S  | 7.5 pounds| 4.5 pounds|\n| Labor       | 9 hours   | 6 hours   |",

        "The number of units of product A to produce": "64",
        "The number of units of product B to produce": "43",
        "The maximum profit": "364.0"
