    "question": "The ABC Firefighting Equipment company has two assembly plants: Plant A in Atlanta and plant B in Buffalo. It has two distribution centers: Center I in Savannah and center II in Pittsburgh. The company can product at most 800 alarm valves per week at plant A and at most 1000 per week at plant B. Center I must have at least 900 alarm valves per week and center II must have at least 600 alarm valves per week. The costs per unit for transportation from the plants to the centers follow. Plant A to center I    $8 Plant A to center II    $12 Plant B to center I    $16 Plant B to center II   $4  Form the constraint inequalities that give the limits for the plants and distribution centers and form the total cost function that is to be minimized. Solve the mixed constraint problem for the minimum transportation cost.",
