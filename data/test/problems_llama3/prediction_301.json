    "question": "A school is organizing a field trip to a science center and wants to hire small buses and large buses. A small bus can carry 20 students while a large bus can carry 50 students.  The school needs to provide transportation for at least 500 students.  In addition, since the parking lot is rather small, a maximum of 20% of the buses can be large buses. How many of each type of bus should be hired to minimize the total number of buses?",
    "results": {
        "The number of small buses": "16",
        "The number of large buses": "4",
        "The total number of buses": "20"
