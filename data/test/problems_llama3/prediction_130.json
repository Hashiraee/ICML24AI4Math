    "question": "A city employs seasonal and permanent snow removers. A seasonal snow remover works 6 hours per shift and gets paid $120. A permanent snow remover works 10 hours per shift and gets paid $250. Currently the city needs 300 hours of snow remover labor after a heavy snowfall. If the city has a budget of $6500, how many of each type of worker should be hired to minimize the total number of snow removers?",
