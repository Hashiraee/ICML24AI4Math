    "question": "In an easy linear program, we have two vectors $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, which $(x_{1},x_{2})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. As the constraints are $x_{1}\\geq0, x_{2}\\geq0,x_{2}-x_{1}\\leq1,x_{1}+6x_{2}\\leq15$, and $4x_{1}-x_{2}\\leq10$. We need to find a point $(x_{1},x_{2})$ of this function to maximize the value $x_{1}+x_{2}$.",
