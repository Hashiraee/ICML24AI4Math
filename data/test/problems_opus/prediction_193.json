    "question": "Euing Gas produces two types of gasoline (gas 1 and gas 2) from two types of oil (oil 1 and oil 2). Each gallon of gas 1 must contain at least 50 percent oil 1, and each gallon of gas 2 must contain at least 60 percent oil 1. Each gallon of gas 1 can be sold for $12, and each gallon of gas 2 can be sold for $14. Currently, 500 gallons of oil 1 and 1,000 gallons of oil 2 are available. As many as 1,500 more gallons of oil 1 can be purchased at the prices shown in the following Table. Formulate an LP that will maximize Euing's profits (revenues - purchasing costs).\n\nTable (Purchasing prices for additional gallons of oil 1):\n| Additional Gallons of Oil 1 | Price per Gallon |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| First 500                   | $25              |\n| Next 500                    | $20              |\n| Next 500                    | $15              |",
