    "question": "A large fast-food restaurant employs waiters and managers. Waiters earn $1200 per week and managers earn $2000 per week. The restaurant requires a minimum of 50 workers of whom at least 15 must be managers. To keep the restaurant clean and running smoothly, the number of managers should be at least a third of the number of waiters. The restaurant wants to keep the weekly wage bill below $500000. Formulate an LP to minimize the wage bill.",
