    "question": "Luke has 200 hectares available to grow carrots and pumpkins. He prefers to plant more carrots than pumpkins, but the soil and weather conditions allow him to grow at most twice the amount of carrots to that of pumpkins. In addition, he must grow at least 25 hectares of carrots and at least 20 hectares of pumpkins to meet community demands. If the profit per hectare of carrots is $300 and the profit per hectare of pumpkins is $500, how many hectares of each item should he plant to maximize profit? What is this profit?",
