    "question": "A bike factory builds two types of bikes: road bikes and mountain bikes. One road bike requires 3 hours of tooling on the grinder and then 2 hours of tooling on the polisher. One mountain bike requires 5 hours of tooling on the grinder and then 2.5 hours of tooling on the polisher. The factory makes a profit of $70 per road bike and $100 per mountain bike. Each machine, the grinder and polisher, can only be used for a maximum of 12 hours per day. How many units of each, road bikes and mountain bikes, should the factory produce to maximize profit?",
