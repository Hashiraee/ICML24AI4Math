    "question": "A banana company sells their bananas in small and large crates. A small crate can hold 20 bananas while a large crate can hole 50 bananas. Since large crates are more manageable, the number of large crates must be at least 1.5 times the number of small crates. However, at least 5 small crates should be used. If the company has available 500 bananas, how many of each crate should the company use to maximize the total number of crates produced?",
    "results": {
        "The number of small crates": "5",
        "The number of large crates": "8",
        "The total number of crates produced": "13"
