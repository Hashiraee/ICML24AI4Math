    "question": "Dorian Auto has a $20,000 advertising budget. Dorian can purchase full-page ads in two magazines: Inside Jocks (IJ) and Family Square (FS). An exposure occurs when a person reads a Dorian Auto ad for the first time. The number of exposures generated by each ad in IJ is as follows: ads 1-6, 10,000 exposures; ads 7-10, 3,000 exposures; ads 11-15, 2,500 exposures; ads 16+, 0 exposures. For example, 8 ads in IJ would generate 6(10,000) + 2(3,000) = 66,000 exposures. The number of exposures generated by each ad in FS is as follows: ads 1-4, 8,000 exposures; ads 5-12, 6,000 exposures; ads 13-15, 2,000 exposures; ads 16+, 0 exposures. Thus, 13 ads in FS would generate 4(8,000) + 8(6,000) + 1(2,000) = 82,000 exposures. Each full-page ad in either magazine costs $1,000. Assume there is no overlap in the readership of the two magazines. Formulate an LP to maximize the number of exposures that Dorian can obtain with limited advertising funds.",
