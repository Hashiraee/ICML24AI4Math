    "question": "Jordan is a chef. He wants to design a diet consisting of Kebabs and Rice.  Assume that each serving of Rice costs $3 and contains 300 calories and 4.5 grams of protein. Assume that each serving of Kebab costs $2 and contains 200 calories and 4 grams of protein. He's interested in spending as little money as possible but he wants to ensure that his meals have at least 2200 calories and at least 30 grams of protein per day. Formulate a linear programming problem that will help minimize the cost of the diet.",
