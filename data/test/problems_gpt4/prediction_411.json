    "question": "Euing Gas produces two types of gasoline (gas 1 and gas 2) from two types of oil (oil 1 and oil 2). Each gallon of gas 1 must contain at least 50 percent oil 1, and each gallon of gas 2 must contain at least 60 percent oil 1. Each gallon of gas 1 can be sold for 12$, and each gallon of gas 2 can be sold for 14$. Currently, 500 gallons of oil 1 and 1,000 gallons of oil 2 are available. As many as 1,500 more gallons of oil 1 can be purchased at the following prices: first 500 gallons, 25$ per gallon; next 500 gallons, 20$ per gallon; next 500 gallons, 15$ per gallon. Formulate an LP that will maximize Euing's profits (revenues - purchasing costs).",
