    "question": "There is only 3000 grams of black tea available to make earl grey and English breakfast teabags. Each earl grey teabag requires 25 grams of black tea while each English breakfast teabag requires 20 grams of black tea. Due to demand, at least 4 times the amount of earl grey teabags are needed than English breakfast. However, at least 20 English breakfast teabags need to be made. If the profit per earl grey teabag is $0.30 and the profit per English breakfast teabag is $0.25, how many of each should be made to maximize profit?",

        "The number of earl grey teabags": "100",
        "The number of English breakfast teabags": "25",
        "The total profit": "36.25"
