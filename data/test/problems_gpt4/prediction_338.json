    "question": "A student takes calcium pills and vitamin D pills one after the other. Each calcium pill takes 5 minutes to be effective while each vitamin D pill takes 6 minutes to be effective. Over a month, the student must take at least 130 pills of medication and at least 40 should be vitamin D pills because they enhance the absorption of calcium in the body. Since vitamin D is complimentary to calcium, the student must take more calcium pills than vitamin D pills. How many pills of each should the student take to minimize the total time it takes for the medication to be effective?",
    "results": {
        "The number of calcium pills": "90.0",
        "The number of vitamin D pills": "40.0",
        "The total time for the medication to be effective": "690.0"
