    "question": "The Healthy Pet Food Company manufactures two types of dog food: Meaties and Yummies. Each package of Meaties contains 2 pounds of cereal and 3 pounds of meat; each package of Yummies contains 3 pounds of cereal and 1.5 pounds of meat. Healthy believes it can sell as much of each dog food as it can make. Meaties sell for $2.80 per package and Yummies sell for $2.00 per package. Healthy's production is limited in several ways. First, Healthy can buy only up to 400,000 pounds of cereal each month at $0.20 per pound. It can buy only up to 300,000 pounds of meat per month at $0.50 per pound. In addition, a special piece of machinery is required to make Meaties, and this machine has a capacity of 90,000 packages per month. The variable cost of blending and packing the dog food is $0.25 per package for Meaties and $0.20 per package for Yummies. Suppose you are the manager of the Dog Food Division of the Healthy Pet Food Company. Your salary is based on division profit, so you try to maximize its profit. How should you operate the division to maximize its profit and your salary?",
