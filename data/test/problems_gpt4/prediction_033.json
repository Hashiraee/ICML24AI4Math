    "question": "A flight has 150 tickets. A profit of $150 is made on each first-class ticket and a profit of $350 is made on each economy-class ticket. The flight reserves at least 20 tickets to be first-class but because the journey is short, at least 3 times as many people prefer to save money and travel by economy-class than first-class. How many of each ticket type should be sold to passengers to maximize profit?",
