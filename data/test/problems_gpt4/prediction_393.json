    "question": "The Office of Nutrition Inspection of the EU recently found out that dishes served at the dining and beverage facility \"Bullneck's\" such  as herring, hot dogs, and house-style hamburgers do not comport with the new nutritional regulations, and its report mentioned explicitly the lack of vitamins A and C and dietary fiber. The owner and operator of the facility is attempting to rectify these shortcomings by augmenting the menu with vegetable side dishes, which he intends to create from white cabbage, carrots, and a stockpile of pickled cucumbers discovered in the cellar. The following table summarizes the numerical data: the prescribed amount of the vitamins and fiber per dish, their content in the foods, and the unit prices of the foods. For example, Carrot Raw contains 35 mg/kg Vitamin A, 60 mg/kg Vitamin C, and Dietary Fiber 30 g/kg as the praise is 0.75 and it's required per dish 0.5mg. For White Cabbage, Raw contains 0.5 mg/kg vitamin A, 300 mg/kg vitamin C, and Dietary Fiber 20 g/kg as the praise is 0.5 and it's required per dish 15mg. For Cucumber, Pickled contains 0.5 mg/kg vitamin A, 10 mg/kg vitamin C, and Dietary Fiber 10 g/kg as the praise is 0.15 and it's required per dish 4g. The objective function expresses the price of the combination. At what minimum additional price per dish can the requirements of the Office of Nutrition Inspection be satisfied?",
